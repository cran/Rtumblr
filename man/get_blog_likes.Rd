\description{
This method can be used to retrieve the publicly exposed likes from a blog. \strong{Seems to work only for your own blog}
}
\details{
You can only provide either before, after, or offset.
If you provide more than one of these options together you will get an error.
You can still use limit with any of those three options to limit your result set.
When using the offset parameter the maximum limit on the offset is 1000. If you would like to get more results than that use either before or after.
