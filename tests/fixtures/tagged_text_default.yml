        noticed that his accent was flowing particularly thick today. Each word swirled
        with Southern syrupiness that sweetened the air before curling into the various
        mahogany surfaces. “That’s the reason we <i>had</i> that chiseled into the
        <b><i>by</i>law</b>s, Jason.” Thomas swiveled in his chair and flashed his
        brightest grin to the smaller, pale gentleman on the other side of the desk.
        The leather of the chair creaked only slightly as the bearings in the base
        offered no complaints to the shift of his weight. His fingers drummed on the
        wooden armrest. The steady <i>tap-tap-tap­ </i>paired well with the beating
        of rain against the windows behind him. Lightning flashed, and that spike
        of light coated the room in a blue-white glare for a split second. A ghostly
        afterimage, like a world only barely perceptible with the naked eye, lingered
        for a moment before the dim incandescent bulbs reasserted the darkened office.
        And then there was Jason.</p><p>Little, <b>pasty</b> Jason sat on the bare
        wooden bench and looked up into Thomas’s face with simple expectation. He
        had his blazer folded on his knees with his hands laced on top. His white
        button-up shirt was immaculately ironed, and the man’s collar could cut hard
        cheese without a fold. Thomas liked Jason. Well, maybe just a bit more than
        he could like any of his supporting staff. That’s why it angered him when
        Jason asked questions that were rhetorical.</p><p>“Every member of this…”
        Thomas twirled his hand as if stirring the ether, “<i>organization</i> needs
        to bring in their keep. Whether it’s through the bounty channels or through
        their own means, everyone <i>delivers</i>. If they don’t produce at least
        one fulfilled contract per month, they’re out.”</p><p>Jason nodded and refolded
        his hands on his lap. “Yes sir. No one is disputing that, sir, but it’s the
        matter of this <i>particular</i> contract-”</p><p>In contrast to Thomas’s
        own voice, Jason’s accent was as flat as his shirt. Thomas steamrolled over
        it with a booming, “You’re referring to the <i>half-bred</i>.”</p><p>He scrutinized
        the little man’s face for a sign of being perturbed at the harsh way Thomas
        had dropped the description from his mouth. It had plopped out like a slur.
        To Jason’s credit, he bore the term with little more than a <b>blink</b>,
        and then nodded in agreement. Damn, but he was a good assistant.</p><p>“Yes
        sir, the half human, half Oryctolagus Cuniculus. Goes by the name of Nib.”
        Jason glanced off to the side. “I’m still a bit miffed that no one has ascertained
        as to whether it’s a code name or not.” He shook his head, and returned his
        smile towards Thomas who merely arched an eyebrow. “Our operatives have been
        delivering payloads regularly. Everyone is on schedule.”</p><p><i>Tap-tap-tap</i>.
        Thomas felt a heat build up behind his eyes. <i>Tap-tap-tap.</i> He leaned
        forward, this time eliciting a quiet groan of complaint from the chair beneath
        him. His fingers came together in front of him and steepled below his chin.
        “It’s a game of numbahs.” He heard the word slip from him without an ‘r’ on
        the end, but the anger was superseding proper diction. “We’ve had the contract
        for this mutated freak in our grasp for <i>five BLAZIN’ years</i>, Jason.”
        Thomas placed his hands on the blotter before him and mentally dared the other
        man to flinch beneath his stare. Jason bore the heat with no outward adjustments.
        “We’ve had other contracts in and out in that time, some as soon as <i>days</i>.”
        The moleskin beneath his fingers began to curl steam from its cool surface
        and the stench of cooking leather began to build beneath his nose. “And yet
        somehow a whole <i>GOT-DAMNED </i>team of professional body brokers can’t
        find one bunny-man and his talkin’ toaster.”</p><p>Jason shifted his grip
        on his own hands again. There was a dip in the man’s smile now. “To be fair,
        sir, the ‘talking toaster’ as you’ve named it is strong, quick, and proficient
        in the art of body guarding.” His eyes dipped towards the desk’s surface where
        lines of char spread from Thomas’s fingers like black lightning. The room
        flashed again as the storm outside continued to beat against the manor’s walls.
        He returned his light, round eyes up to his boss’s face. “Everyone has met
        their quotas, sir.” The smile, that little line of <b>suave</b> confidence,
        curved again beneath Jason’s nose.</p><p><i>It&rsquo;d be hard to smile through
        a scar,</i> Thomas thought before he realized what he was thinking. He froze.
        Crackling sounds were starting to come from the desk’s surface. He lifted
        his fingers from the ruined blotter and sat back, willing the heat to recede
        back into his core. He laced his fingers over his gut and turned to face back
        out the windows. He could still feel the anger slithering and chafing inside,
        begging for a physical release. He snorted as he examined the roiling sky
        and its organic light show. “I want him found, bagged, and tagged, Jason.
        With <i>prejudice</i> that would make my <i>ancestors</i> blush, is that clear?”</p><p>There
        was a long pause. Thomas could only assume Jason was consulting something
        on his phone before he responded. He was no doubt responding to the messages
        that had led him to requesting this meeting. Thomas heard the little click
        of the phone being locked before Jason asked, “They’ll need assurances that
        no one will be fired simply because they fail one acquisition if their ledgers
        are in the black, sir. Otherwise…”</p><p>Thomas nodded. The squirming, liquid
        heat of his fire raged within him, aching to be released. His eyes darted
        across the racing clouds above. “Fine. But I swear to the Lord above, Jason.
        If I so much as sniff the color red in one of their books, the example set
        by their dismissal will make last week’s bonfire seem like a snuffed-out match.”</p><p>“That’s
        all they’ll need to hear, sir,” Jason agreed. “Good night, sir.” Thomas never
        heard the small man get up or walk away. The only indication he had of the
        assistant’s exit was the muted catch of the door in its frame.</p>\",\"reblog\":{\"comment\":\"<p><h1>Monthly

        noticed that his accent was flowing particularly thick today. Each word swirled
        with Southern syrupiness that sweetened the air before curling into the various
        mahogany surfaces. “That’s the reason we <i>had</i> that chiseled into the
        <b><i>by</i>law</b>s, Jason.” Thomas swiveled in his chair and flashed his
        brightest grin to the smaller, pale gentleman on the other side of the desk.
        The leather of the chair creaked only slightly as the bearings in the base
        offered no complaints to the shift of his weight. His fingers drummed on the
        wooden armrest. The steady <i>tap-tap-tap­ </i>paired well with the beating
        of rain against the windows behind him. Lightning flashed, and that spike
        of light coated the room in a blue-white glare for a split second. A ghostly
        afterimage, like a world only barely perceptible with the naked eye, lingered
        for a moment before the dim incandescent bulbs reasserted the darkened office.
        And then there was Jason.</p><p>Little, <b>pasty</b> Jason sat on the bare
        wooden bench and looked up into Thomas’s face with simple expectation. He
        had his blazer folded on his knees with his hands laced on top. His white
        button-up shirt was immaculately ironed, and the man’s collar could cut hard
        cheese without a fold. Thomas liked Jason. Well, maybe just a bit more than
        he could like any of his supporting staff. That’s why it angered him when
        Jason asked questions that were rhetorical.</p><p>“Every member of this…”
        Thomas twirled his hand as if stirring the ether, “<i>organization</i> needs
        to bring in their keep. Whether it’s through the bounty channels or through
        their own means, everyone <i>delivers</i>. If they don’t produce at least
        one fulfilled contract per month, they’re out.”</p><p>Jason nodded and refolded
        his hands on his lap. “Yes sir. No one is disputing that, sir, but it’s the
        matter of this <i>particular</i> contract-”</p><p>In contrast to Thomas’s
        own voice, Jason’s accent was as flat as his shirt. Thomas steamrolled over
        it with a booming, “You’re referring to the <i>half-bred</i>.”</p><p>He scrutinized
        the little man’s face for a sign of being perturbed at the harsh way Thomas
        had dropped the description from his mouth. It had plopped out like a slur.
        To Jason’s credit, he bore the term with little more than a <b>blink</b>,
        and then nodded in agreement. Damn, but he was a good assistant.</p><p>“Yes
        sir, the half human, half Oryctolagus Cuniculus. Goes by the name of Nib.”
        Jason glanced off to the side. “I’m still a bit miffed that no one has ascertained
        as to whether it’s a code name or not.” He shook his head, and returned his
        smile towards Thomas who merely arched an eyebrow. “Our operatives have been
        delivering payloads regularly. Everyone is on schedule.”</p><p><i>Tap-tap-tap</i>.
        Thomas felt a heat build up behind his eyes. <i>Tap-tap-tap.</i> He leaned
        forward, this time eliciting a quiet groan of complaint from the chair beneath
        him. His fingers came together in front of him and steepled below his chin.
        “It’s a game of numbahs.” He heard the word slip from him without an ‘r’ on
        the end, but the anger was superseding proper diction. “We’ve had the contract
        for this mutated freak in our grasp for <i>five BLAZIN’ years</i>, Jason.”
        Thomas placed his hands on the blotter before him and mentally dared the other
        man to flinch beneath his stare. Jason bore the heat with no outward adjustments.
        “We’ve had other contracts in and out in that time, some as soon as <i>days</i>.”
        The moleskin beneath his fingers began to curl steam from its cool surface
        and the stench of cooking leather began to build beneath his nose. “And yet
        somehow a whole <i>GOT-DAMNED </i>team of professional body brokers can’t
        find one bunny-man and his talkin’ toaster.”</p><p>Jason shifted his grip
        on his own hands again. There was a dip in the man’s smile now. “To be fair,
        sir, the ‘talking toaster’ as you’ve named it is strong, quick, and proficient
        in the art of body guarding.” His eyes dipped towards the desk’s surface where
        lines of char spread from Thomas’s fingers like black lightning. The room
        flashed again as the storm outside continued to beat against the manor’s walls.
        He returned his light, round eyes up to his boss’s face. “Everyone has met
        their quotas, sir.” The smile, that little line of <b>suave</b> confidence,
        curved again beneath Jason’s nose.</p><p><i>It’d be hard to smile through
        a scar,</i> Thomas thought before he realized what he was thinking. He froze.
        Crackling sounds were starting to come from the desk’s surface. He lifted
        his fingers from the ruined blotter and sat back, willing the heat to recede
        back into his core. He laced his fingers over his gut and turned to face back
        out the windows. He could still feel the anger slithering and chafing inside,
        begging for a physical release. He snorted as he examined the roiling sky
        and its organic light show. “I want him found, bagged, and tagged, Jason.
        With <i>prejudice</i> that would make my <i>ancestors</i> blush, is that clear?”</p><p>There
        was a long pause. Thomas could only assume Jason was consulting something
        on his phone before he responded. He was no doubt responding to the messages
        that had led him to requesting this meeting. Thomas heard the little click
        of the phone being locked before Jason asked, “They’ll need assurances that
        no one will be fired simply because they fail one acquisition if their ledgers
        are in the black, sir. Otherwise…”</p><p>Thomas nodded. The squirming, liquid
        heat of his fire raged within him, aching to be released. His eyes darted
        across the racing clouds above. “Fine. But I swear to the Lord above, Jason.
        If I so much as sniff the color red in one of their books, the example set
        by their dismissal will make last week’s bonfire seem like a snuffed-out match.”</p><p>“That’s
        all they’ll need to hear, sir,” Jason agreed. “Good night, sir.” Thomas never
        heard the small man get up or walk away. The only indication he had of the
        assistant’s exit was the muted catch of the door in its frame.</p></p>\",\"tree_html\":\"\"},\"trail\":[{\"blog\":{\"name\":\"sittinwithyou\",\"active\":true,\"theme\":{\"header_full_width\":1350,\"header_full_height\":450,\"header_focus_width\":759,\"header_focus_height\":426,\"avatar_shape\":\"circle\",\"background_color\":\"#dcecf5\",\"body_font\":\"Helvetica

        I wrote something for the first time in ages, and I’m really excited to share

        Here it is.</p><p>“So, you’re trans, right?” A short story.</p><!-- more --><p>“So,
        you’re trans, right?” Four words. </p><p>Four words that shouldn’t matter
        as much as they do, shouldn’t sting as they do. </p><p>Four words that say,
        I know better than you. </p><p>I get it, I really do. You want someone else
        like you, someone you can show to your parents and say, “See? I am not the
        only one, the strange being.” I get it. I know how you feel. You want to say,
        if this person, younger than me, just barely a teen, can be themself, why
        can’t I?</p><p>Except I am not transgender. I am by no means <i>cis</i> either,
        but still. I am a person outside of what you know about gender. If your gender
        is 3-dimensional, has a shape, mine is 4- or 5-dimensional, beyond even my
        comprehension, let alone yours. </p><p>You do not understand. That’s okay,
        I like it when people don’t understand.</p><p>But you won’t just leave it
        be. Instead of allowing yourself to not comprehend, you tack on a word you
        <i>do </i>understand, although it doesn’t fit what I mean, what I <i>am</i>. </p><p>You
        forget where we are. We are in a sanctuary, a place for kids like you and
        like me, kids who aren&rsquo;t cis, or cis <i>enough </i>for other’s eyes. </p><p>So
        if you want transness, look around. Look, over there to those girls sitting
        together, holding hands. (They think we don’t know. We all do.) Listen. What
        are they talking about? They’re talking about where to find gender clinics,
        who will give them a prescription for estrogen. They’re talking about it as
        though discussing drug dealers, all hushed tones and shifting eyes. They forget,
        too, that no one here will judge them or report them or gossip or any number
        of horrible things that happen to trans kids.</p><p>If you want more proof
        that you’re not the only one, keep looking around. Look, in the other direction.
        Do you see? Do you see the boy on the grass, sitting with his mother and another
        man somewhere in his twenties, talking about ways to start binding his chest?
        Look at him, younger than me, and younger than you by far, only twelve years
        old. Twelve! And see how he slouches over his chest, and only wears those
        baggy shirts, most of which advertise various Five Nights at Freddy’s games
        or characters. (No accounting for taste, but he is just another tween, unapologetically
        happy about some game series that he likes.)</p><p> I see more happy trans
        kids around, as well as kids with other genders, or multiple genders, or no
        gender at all here, than I do in several months at home.</p><p>So look, look
        around and you’ll find so many trans kids, more than you’ve ever seen in one
        place before. </p><p>And all of them, all of the people here, aside from families,
        and sometimes including families, have been hurt, sometimes physically and
        sometimes verbally and sometimes a mix of both. And yet, and yet, still we
        are here and happy.</p><p>So do not worry. Let yourself be who you are and
        let me be who I am. Look at me, and look around you, and know you will be
        okay. </p><p>I am not trans. But you are, and that is good. I know you have
        been hurt before. But for now, relax and enjoy the sunshine and the fact that
